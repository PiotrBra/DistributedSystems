# Chat - Chat Application with TCP, UDP, and Multicast Support

The application consists of a server and a client, enabling communication using three protocols: TCP, UDP, and multicast.

## Features:
- **TCP**: Communication with the server, broadcasting messages to all clients.
- **UDP**: Faster communication, ideal for transmitting data such as ASCII Art.
- **Multicast**: Sending messages to a multicast group without server involvement.
